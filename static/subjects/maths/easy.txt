 Which of the following sets is not part of the real number system? |  Rational numbers | Imaginary numbers | Irrational numbers | Natural numbers | b
 According to the Archimedean Property, for any two positive real numbers x and y:| x<yx < yx<y implies xn<yx^n < yxn<y for all n∈Nn \in \mathbb{N}n∈N | There exists a natural number nnn such that n⋅x>yn \cdot x > yn⋅x>y |  x is always greater than y when multiplied by a large nnn | x and y have no upper bound.|b
A sequence {an}\{a_n\}{an} is said to be convergent if: | {an}\{a_n\}{an} is unbounded. |{an}\{a_n\}{an} has no limit. | {an}\{a_n\}{an} approaches a finite limit as n→∞n \to \inftyn→∞. | {an}\{a_n\}{an} oscillates indefinitely. | c
 If a sequence {an}\{a_n\}{an} is monotone and bounded,then: |It is necessarily divergent | It is necessarily convergent. | It must have negative values. | It does not have a limit. | b
The Cauchy Criterion for convergence of a sequence states that | Every sequence is Cauchy. | A sequence is Cauchy if and only if it is convergent. | A sequence is Cauchy if it has a subsequence. | A sequence is Cauchy if its terms are bounded. | b 
The Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem asserts that every bounded sequence has: | A unique limit. | A limit equal to zero. | At least one convergent subsequence. |  An unbounded limit. | c

 For an infinite series ∑an\sum a_n∑an to converge | The terms ana_nan must tend to zero as n→∞n \to \inftyn→∞. | ana_nan can be any positive value.| The series must be divergent. | The partial sums must diverge. | a
